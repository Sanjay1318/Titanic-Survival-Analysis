# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis | Python + Power BI

This project analyzes passenger survival patterns from the Titanic disaster using **Python (EDA)** and a **Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To understand which passenger groups had higher chances of survival by analyzing:
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Age Groups

---

## 🧠 Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Power BI Dashboard Design
- Data Storytelling

---

## 📊 Key Insights

| Factor | Insight |
|-------|--------|
| **Overall Survival** | Only **38.38%** passengers survived |
| **Gender Impact** | **74% of females** survived vs **19% of males** |
| **Class Impact** | **1st-class** passengers had **63% survival**, 3rd-class only **24%** |
| **Age Impact** | **Children** had highest chance of survival |

➡️ “Women & children first” protocol strongly influenced results
